## *What is Code Burgers?*

Responsive RESTful MVC web app built with Node, Express, Handlebars, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL and Adobe CC.  For this project I hand rolled an ORM to deal with queries going to the mySql database and connected HTML using the Express-Handlebars npm package.
Code Burgers is deployed through Heroku using an attatched JawsDb database connection

## *The How and the Why*

Code Burgers is a full stack interactive Web Application.
Originially asigned as a practice activity as a part of the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp, I was able to add an element of Web Development and make it useful as a "to-do" app of sorts.  Any languages or Libraries the user would like learn in the future can be added to the Code Burgers Datatbase, perfereably as a pun of some sort, but this is up to the user.  Use it to list the code you'd like to learn or "devour" and click to devour! Keep track of future learning and list help from others to stay on top of what you know and what you'd like to know!
